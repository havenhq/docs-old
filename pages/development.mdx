# Development

How to run Haven in dev mode and contribute to the project.

## Project structure

```bash
/manager 	# Haven deployment
/proto 		# API definitions
/sdk		# SDK code
/worker		# Code that runs on a worker that is spawned by the manager
```

### Running the manager locally

You can run the manager on your machine by installing the dependencies and running `npm run dev` inside the `/manager` directory. You can just drop your `./key.json` file inside `/manager` or alternatively provide it as you would when setting up Haven normally.

### Modifying and testing worker code

I'm open to suggestions here, but this is the way we're developing the worker when making quick edits:

1. Create a worker using the SDK

2. SSH into the machine that is running the worker (you can do this using the `gcloud` CLI or the Google Cloud Console web-UI)

3. Switch to superuser using `sudo su`

4. Run `docker container ps -a` to identify the container that is currently running the Haven worker

```filename="example output"
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                          COMMAND           CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES
c8ba242a97be   havenhq/worker   "python -m app"   5 minutes ago   Up 5 minutes   0.0.0.0:5001->5001/tcp   friendly_mcnulty
```

5. Stop this container using `docker stop c8ba242a97be`

6. Now, you can create a new docker container from the Haven image and run bash inside using this command:

```bash copy
docker run -it -v /usr/local/nvidia:/usr/local/nvidia -v ~/config.json:/app/config.json --gpus all --shm-size=52.0gb -p 50051:50051 havenhq/worker /bin/bash
```

This should open a bash terminal inside the docker container. If you want you can install vim (or any other editor) by running.

```bash
apt update
apt install vim -y
```

To make changes, edit the files accordingly. To run the worker, run python -m app from the working directory of the container (you can get there with cd /app)

While python is running, you can send requests to the worker as you normally would using the manager.
