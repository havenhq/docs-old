# Telemetry

Haven collects **anonymous** usage data to better understand how we can improve the software. If you want to disable this, you can opt out any time. To collect usage data, we use [Posthog](https://posthog.com/), an open source product analytics platform.

### What Haven reports

Haven anonymously collects two types of events:
- resource creation events (spinning up a manager or inference worker)
- health checks for running inference workers

### Disable Telemetry

To opt out of usage data collection, you can pass an environment variable `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true` when creating the manager:



```bash copy
gcloud compute instances create-with-container haven-manager --container-image havenhq/haven --machine-type e2-micro --container-env BEARER_TOKEN=<some-bearer-token> --container-env DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true --tags=http-server,https-server
```
